# HTML Website: Recipes

1. HTML

    This first little project is the first step in my web development journey.
    The essential [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is to create a simple static webpage with plain HTML files.
    One goal is to practise writing HTML files with the corresponding boilerplate code.
    Further, one should work with various HTML elements and consider during that process the accessibility requirements.

2. CSS (Update)

    A subsequent [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations#assignment) suggested coming back to the HTML project and applying various CSS styling.
    Note that the CSS styling applied to the project is not optimal.
    Its purpose is to play around with learned selectors and how one can effectively target different elements in an HTML file.

## Lessons learned

Creating a simple website with HTML is straightforward.
Solely focusing on the structure is essential, especially considering accessibility, meaning utilising elements with the appropriate semantic meaning.
Besides the HTML aspect, a project requires good structure because larger projects probably become unreadable.
