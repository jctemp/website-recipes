# HTML Website: Recipes

This first little project is the first step in my web development journey.
The essential [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is to create a simple static webpage with plain HTML files.
One goal is to practise writing HTML files with the corresponding boilerplate code.
Further, one should work with various HTML elements and consider during that process the accessibility requirements.

## Lessons learned

Creating a simple website with HTML is straightforward.
Solely focusing on the structure is essential, especially considering accessibility, meaning utilising elements with the appropriate semantic meaning.
Besides the HTML aspect, a project requires good structure because larger projects probably become unreadable.
