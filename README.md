# HTML Website: Recipes

This first little project is the first step in my web development journey.
The essential [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is to create a simple static webpage with plain HTML files.
One goal is to practise writing HTML files with the corresponding boilerplate code.
Further, one should work with various HTML elements and consider during that process the accessibility requirements.
