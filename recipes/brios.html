    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="width: 512px;">
        Brioches are excellent for breakfast because of their slightly sweet flavour.
        But, making them fresh is the best experience one can have, being a sensation for all senses.
        Note that making them a day before eating them is not ideal. Still, they maintain taste.
        You can find the original recipe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrWLuHK7sAg">here</a>.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Mix the yeast with a bit of warm milk and flour-sugar mixture.</li>
